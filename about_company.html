<H2> About Us</H2>



<P> After long and rewarding careers in London, in 1999 we moved to our beautiful home in Devon. We felt ready for a change to our lifestyle, in order to enjoy our young children more. I was still programming as a contractor and then finally as part of a small team trying to develop our own product. The venture, though good fun, didn’t work out and so, in 2003 we decided to open Brambles Art Retreat – and I finally got back to my painting roots!
